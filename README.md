# **DataViz-Project1: Drug Mortality and Socio-Economic Conditions in Connecticut**     


### Project Proposal      
We are looking to analyze trends in drug overdose death rates in Connecticut and suggest improvements in data collection. And the research of the project aims to answer the following questions:    


**Is there a relationship between**  

* drug-induced mortality rates and income?   
* drug-induced mortality rates and age?    
* drug-induced mortality rates and education?    
* drug-induced mortality rates and gender?    
* drug-induced mortality rates and geo-location (counties)?    
* drug-induced mortality rates and unemployment rates?    
* drug-induced mortality rates and barriers to medical treatment?

### Data Cleanup &amp; Analysis

*Accidental Drug Overdose Related Deaths in Connecticut 2012-2017.csv* is the raw dataset this project uses for the research. This dataset was retrieved from [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015). With this dataset in hand, the first thing is to import the data into a dataframe and explore it.   

#### Columns
The dataset has 36 columns including the information about the dead such as *Sex*, *Age*, *Residence City* and the information related to the death such as *Death City*, *Death County*, *InjuryPlace*, *DescriptionofInjury*. In addition, the drug types that are causing the death are included in the dataset.   
```python
# Import the raw data
drug_death_raw_df = pd.read_csv("../Resources/Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2017.csv")
drug_death_raw_df = drug_death_raw_df[1:]
drug_death_raw_df.columns
```




    Index(['CaseNumber', 'Date', 'Year', 'Sex', 'Race', 'Age', 'Residence City',
           'Residence State', 'Residence County', 'Death City', 'Death State',
           'Death County', 'Location', 'DescriptionofInjury', 'InjuryPlace',
           'ImmediateCauseA', 'Heroin', 'Cocaine', 'Fentanyl', 'Oxycodone',
           'Oxymorphone', 'EtOH', 'Hydrocodone', 'Benzodiazepine', 'Methadone',
           'Amphet', 'Tramad', 'Morphine (not heroin)', 'Other', 'Any Opioid',
           'MannerofDeath', 'AmendedMannerofDeath', 'DeathLoc',
           'DeathLocationCity', 'DeathLocLat', 'DeathLocLong'],
          dtype='object')  
		  
#### Value Counts  
There are 4082 drug overdose related deaths in the dataset. However, the output of *drug_death_raw_df.count()* clearly shows that not each column has 4082 rows. For example, the column *Age* has 4080 values and 2 values are missing.
Take the column *Death County* for example, it has 3430 value counts which are much less than the total death cases. But since both *DeathLocLat* and *DeathLocLong* have 4082 values, we can utilize the google api along with the latitude and longitude to retrieve the death county.
Besides, we realized that even though some columns are missing values, it does not mean the data is not good. For example, a drug overdose related death is caused by Heroin and Cocaine, then other drug columns are empty. The column such as *Death State* is missing almost 50 percent of 
values. But we can fill the empty values with `CT` as the dataset was collected in Connecticut.  

```python
# Import the raw data
drug_death_raw_df = pd.read_csv("../Resources/Accidental_Drug_Related_Deaths_2012-2017.csv")
drug_death_raw_df = drug_death_raw_df[1:]
drug_death_raw_df.count()
```

Similarly, after you've massaged your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should keep track of your work in a Jupyter Notebook dedicated specifically to analysis.

During both phases, **don't forget to include plots**! Don't make the mistake of waiting to build figures until you're preparing your presentation. Creating them along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice otherwise.

We recommend focusing your analysis on techniques such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.

Finally, be sure that your projects meet the [technical requirements](TechnicalRequirements.md).

### Presentation

After you've analyzed your data to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.

This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and should give your classmates and instructional staff an overview of your work. PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are all acceptable for building slides.

As long as your slides meet the [presentation requirements](PresentationRequirements.md), you are free to structure the presentation however you wish, but students are often successful with the format laid out in the [presentation guidelines](PresentationGuidelines.md).


## Technical Requirements
**The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.**

- [ ] Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

- [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process

- [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**

- [ ] Use Matplotlib to create a total of **6-8 visualizations** of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

- [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

- [ ] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

- [ ] Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

## Presentation Requirements
**The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.**

Your presentation must:

- [ ] Be at least 8-10 min. long

- [ ] Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.

- [ ] Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

- [ ] Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

- [ ] Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

- [ ] Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

- [ ] Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

- [ ] Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".

- [ ] Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.


## Presentation Guidelines
**You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have succes with the following format.**

* Title Slide
  * Include the name of the Project and Group Members

* Motivation &amp; Summary Slide
  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
  * Describe the questions you asked, and _why_ you asked them
  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfication, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions &amp; Data
  * Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it

* Data Cleanup &amp; Exploration
  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis
  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion
  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem
  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&amp;A with the audience
